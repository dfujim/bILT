	abstract = "The empirical dielectric decay function {$\gamma$}(t)= exp –(t/{$\tau$}0){$\beta$} may be transformed analytically to give the frequency dependent complex dielectric constant if {$\beta$} is chosen to be 0.50. The resulting dielectric constant and dielectric loss curves are non-symmetrical about the logarithm of the frequency of maximum loss, and are intermediate between the Cole-Cole and Davidson-Cole empirical relations. Using a short extrapolation procedure, good agreement is obtained between the empirical representation and the experimental curves for the {$\alpha$} relaxation in polyethyl acrylate. It is suggested that the present representation would have a general application to the {$\alpha$} relaxations in other polymers. The Hamon approximation, with a small applied correction, is valid for the present function with {$\beta$}= 0.50 in the range log({$\omega$}{$\tau$}0) > –0.5, but cannot be used at lower frequencies."

The model assumes randomly distributed defect centres, typical of glasses, producing internal fluctuating fields. The only restrictive assumption is a power law for the distance dependence of the responsible interaction. In accordance with experiment, homogeneous and inhomogeneous relaxation, corresponding to exponential and non-exponential relaxation behaviour, is predicted in the cases of rapid and slow spin diffusion, respectively. Describing the fluctuating interactions by a BPP-type spectral density and assuming an Arrhenius law for the correlation time, explicit expressions for T-1− are obtained. It is shown that by comparison of homogeneous and inhomogeneous relaxation data information on the type of interaction and the density of defect centres can be obtained."

	abstract={The spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) of polarised radioactive 8 Li nuclei in solid Li-based alloys containing 2-11 at.\% Mg and 1.6-10 at.\% Ag was measured via their asymmetric beta -decay radiation. For temperatures T<200K SLR is due to conduction electrons only, and the Korringa relation is found to hold in the concentration range covered. For T=200-450K, SLR is additionally influenced by atomic diffusion. The diffusional contribution consists of a dipolar part as in pure Li and a quadrupolar part induced by the solute ions. The analysis is based on the concept of two-exponential SLR for spin I=2. In Li-Mg the self-diffusion of Li and the diffusion of the solute ions are found to be slowed down on alloying. The ratio of the jump rates of Li and Mg appears to be determined simply by their atomic masses. In the case of the dilute alloy Li-1.6 at.\% Ag, which is amenable to theoretical diffusion models, comparison with tracer results favours an interstitial-vacancy pair mechanism. In the framework of this model Ag is found to diffuse faster than Li.}

Below T approximately=200 K the electric field gradients (EFG) at the two inequivalent Li lattice sites (Li(1), Li(2)) were determined. The spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) behavior above T approximately=300 K and the 8 Li NMR signals in the extreme narrowing regime (T>or=500 K) could be attributed to interlayer diffusion involving Li + jumps between Li(1) and Li(2) lattice sites ((1 to or from 2) jumps). In the temperature range 200 K<or=T<or=300 K the transients of the 8 Li(1) and 8 Li(2) polarizations were measured separately by applying a special radio frequency scheme. The different SLR behaviour allowed us to study the Li + intralayer diffusion confined to the Li 2 N layers. Furthermore, ultra-slow interlayer (1 to or from 2) jumps with correlation times of up to 10 s were observed in this T region. Below 200 K a nonexponential 8 Li polarization decay depending weakly on B and T was observed. The SLR in this T range is discussed in terms of statistically distributed relaxation centres.}

	abstract = "Spin-lattice relaxation in solids often deviates from the usual exponential law, for example, in dilute spin-12 solids like silicon carbide, when relaxation arises from fixed paramagnetic impurities. We examine nonexponential spin-lattice relaxation from the point of view of nonlinear regression to the stretched-exponential function M({$\tau$}) = a − bexp[−({$\tau$}/T′)n], where n is typically 1 or 0.5 but can have intermediate values. Criteria for error estimation as well as an optimal choice of delay times {$\tau$} are examined in detail and tested on typical data from our studies on silicon carbide. Two methods are outlined for the estimation of confidence intervals which are typically found to be somewhat larger than the standard errors in the parameters. The typical experiment for determination of spin-lattice relaxation time is found to be robust even when relaxation is nonexponential. The determinant of the curvature matrix is a good experimental design criterion and correlates well with the estimated errors. While any reasonable choice of points yields good results, an optimal choice of delay times {$\tau$} can be made by following the guidelines presented here."

	abstract = {Unlike the positive muon, we expect the chemistry of the implanted 8 Li + {$\beta$} -NMR probe in organic polymers to be simply that of the monovalent ion, but almost nothing is known about the NMR of isolated Li+ in this context. Here, we present a brief survey of 8 Li + {$\beta$} -NMR in a variety of insulating polymers at high magnetic field, including polyimide, PET, polycarbonate, polystyrene and polyethylene oxide. In all cases, we find a large-amplitude, broad Lorentzian resonance near the Larmor frequency, consistent with the expected diamagnetic charge state. We also find remarkably fast spin-lattice relaxation rates 1/ T 1 . There is very little dependence of either linewidth or 1/ T 1 on the proton density, the main source of nuclear dipolar magnetic fields, leading us to conclude the main contribution to both broadening and spin relaxation at room temperature is quadrupolar in origin. This behaviour is very different from crystalline insulators such as MgO and Al 2 O 3 , and suggests that 8 Li + {$\beta$} -NMR will be an important probe of polymer dynamics. Additionally, we note dramatically different behaviour of one sample above its glass transition, motivating the construction of a high temperature spectrometer to enable further exploration at elevated temperature.}

PS-d8 films annealed with the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) deposited on the surface show enhanced dynamics in the bulk compared with a pure PS-d8 film and a PS-d8 film where the SDS was washed away.

	abstract = {We demonstrate the application of implanted-ion {$\beta$}-detected NMR as a probe of ionic liquid molecular dynamics through the measurement of 8Li spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) and resonance in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. The motional narrowing of the resonance and the local maxima in the SLR rate, 1/T1, imply sensitivity to subnanosecond Li+ solvation dynamics. From an analysis of 1/T1, we extract an activation energy EA = 74.8(1.5) meV and Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann constant TVFT = 165.8(0.9) K, in agreement with the dynamic viscosity of the bulk solvent. Near the melting point, the lineshape is broad and intense, and the form of the relaxation is nonexponential, reflective of our sensitivity to heterogeneous dynamics near the glass transition. The depth resolution of this technique may later provide a unique means of studying nanoscale phenomena in ionic liquids.}

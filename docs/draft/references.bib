The resulting dielectric constant and dielectric loss curves are non-symmetrical about the logarithm of the frequency of maximum loss, and are intermediate between the Cole-Cole and Davidson-Cole empirical relations. Using a short extrapolation procedure, good agreement is obtained between the empirical representation and the experimental curves for the {$\alpha$} relaxation in polyethyl acrylate. It is suggested that the present representation would have a general application to the {$\alpha$} relaxations in other polymers. The Hamon approximation, with a small applied correction, is valid for the present function with {$\beta$}= 0.50 in the range log({$\omega$}{$\tau$}0) > –0.5, but cannot be used at lower frequencies."

An important example is the nuclear dipole-dipole interaction. In order to restrict the length of this review we consider only experiments where the probe nuclei have been created and oriented ``in-beam'', i.e., by reactions with a particle beam during the course of the measurement. Thus, the important area of low temperature nuclear orientation ($\tau$N ≳ 1 h) is omitted here, but this has been excellently treated in several recent reviews [6.1,2]. We discuss here all in-beam experiments using $\beta$ emitting nuclides ($\tau$N ≈ 10−2 -- 103 s) in condensed matter. Further, those in-beam experiments using isomeric $\gamma$ emitters are reviewed, where nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals were observed or where spin-lattice relaxation phenomena --- mostly in liquid metals --- were investigated ($\tau$N ≈ 10−5 -- 10−2 s)The many other experiments applying short-lived $\gamma$ active nuclei to solid state studies have been discussed in Chaps.4 and 5.",

The disadvantage of the inversion methods of that type, the encountered dependence of discretization and truncation error on the free parameters, is removed by the simultaneous application of a procedure for the reduction of the discretization error, a method for accelerating the convergence of the Fourier series and a procedure that computes approximately the ‘best’ choice of the free parameters. Suitable for a given problem, the inversion method allows the adequate application of these procedures. Therefore, in a big range of applications a high accuracy can be achieved with only a few function evaluations of the Laplace transform. The inversion method is implemented as a FORTRAN subroutine."

The model assumes randomly distributed defect centres, typical of glasses, producing internal fluctuating fields. The only restrictive assumption is a power law for the distance dependence of the responsible interaction. In accordance with experiment, homogeneous and inhomogeneous relaxation, corresponding to exponential and non-exponential relaxation behaviour, is predicted in the cases of rapid and slow spin diffusion, respectively. Describing the fluctuating interactions by a BPP-type spectral density and assuming an Arrhenius law for the correlation time, explicit expressions for T-1− are obtained. It is shown that by comparison of homogeneous and inhomogeneous relaxation data information on the type of interaction and the density of defect centres can be obtained."

For temperatures T<200K SLR is due to conduction electrons only, and the Korringa relation is found to hold in the concentration range covered. For T=200-450K, SLR is additionally influenced by atomic diffusion. The diffusional contribution consists of a dipolar part as in pure Li and a quadrupolar part induced by the solute ions. The analysis is based on the concept of two-exponential SLR for spin I=2. In Li-Mg the self-diffusion of Li and the diffusion of the solute ions are found to be slowed down on alloying. The ratio of the jump rates of Li and Mg appears to be determined simply by their atomic masses. In the case of the dilute alloy Li-1.6 at.\% Ag, which is amenable to theoretical diffusion models, comparison with tracer results favours an interstitial-vacancy pair mechanism. In the framework of this model Ag is found to diffuse faster than Li.}

Below T approximately=200 K the electric field gradients (EFG) at the two inequivalent Li lattice sites (Li(1), Li(2)) were determined. The spin-lattice relaxation (SLR) behavior above T approximately=300 K and the 8 Li NMR signals in the extreme narrowing regime (T>or=500 K) could be attributed to interlayer diffusion involving Li + jumps between Li(1) and Li(2) lattice sites ((1 to or from 2) jumps). In the temperature range 200 K<or=T<or=300 K the transients of the 8 Li(1) and 8 Li(2) polarizations were measured separately by applying a special radio frequency scheme. The different SLR behaviour allowed us to study the Li + intralayer diffusion confined to the Li 2 N layers. Furthermore, ultra-slow interlayer (1 to or from 2) jumps with correlation times of up to 10 s were observed in this T region. Below 200 K a nonexponential 8 Li polarization decay depending weakly on B and T was observed. The SLR in this T range is discussed in terms of statistically distributed relaxation centres.}

We examine nonexponential spin-lattice relaxation from the point of view of nonlinear regression to the stretched-exponential function M({$\tau$}) = a − bexp[−({$\tau$}/T′)n], where n is typically 1 or 0.5 but can have intermediate values. Criteria for error estimation as well as an optimal choice of delay times {$\tau$} are examined in detail and tested on typical data from our studies on silicon carbide. Two methods are outlined for the estimation of confidence intervals which are typically found to be somewhat larger than the standard errors in the parameters. The typical experiment for determination of spin-lattice relaxation time is found to be robust even when relaxation is nonexponential. The determinant of the curvature matrix is a good experimental design criterion and correlates well with the estimated errors. While any reasonable choice of points yields good results, an optimal choice of delay times {$\tau$} can be made by following the guidelines presented here."

	abstract = {Although generalized cross-validation is a popular tool for calculating a regularization parameter, it has been rarely applied to large-scale problems until recently. A major difficulty lies in the evaluation of the cross-validation function that requires the calculation of the trace of an inverse matrix. In the last few years stochastic trace estimators have been proposed to alleviate this problem. This article demonstrates numerical approximation techniques that further reduce the computational complexity. The new approach employs Gauss quadrature to compute lower and upper bounds on the cross-validation function. It only requires the operator form of the system matrix—that is, a subroutine to evaluate matrix-vector products. Thus, the factorization of large matrices can be avoided. The new approach has been implemented in MATLAB. Numerical experiments confirm the remarkable accuracy of the stochastic trace estimator. Regularization parameters are computed for ill-posed problems with 100, 1,000, and 10,000 unknowns.}

A general approach to solve for the bridge estimator is developed. A new algorithm for the lasso ({$\gamma$} = 1) is obtained by studying the structure of the bridge estimators. The shrinkage parameter {$\gamma$} and the tuning parameter {$\lambda$} are selected via generalized cross-validation (GCV). Comparison between the bridge model ({$\gamma$} ≤ 1) and several other shrinkage models, namely the ordinary least squares regression ({$\lambda$} = 0), the lasso ({$\gamma$} = 1) and ridge regression ({$\gamma$} = 2), is made through a simulation study. It is shown that the bridge regression performs well compared to the lasso and ridge regression. These methods are demonstrated through an analysis of a prostate cancer data. Some computational advantages and limitations are discussed.}

Beams of short-lived radioactive ions have applications in many different areas of physics including condensed matter research. At ISAC we are developing the technique of beta-detected nuclear magnetic resonance ({$\beta$}-NMR) as a tool for investigating thin structures and dilute impurities. Large nuclear spin polarization can be generated using a fast collinear laser method so that a beam of highly spin polarized ions can be implanted at low energies (1–90 keV). In this paper we describe the facility and the initial experimental program with emphasis on how this technique can complement {$\mu$}SR."

This regularization property is specially useful when either the right-hand side or the coefficient matrix, or both are given with errors. The regularization parameter is the iteration number, and in order to find this parameter, the L-curve is used. Here we present a novel method to find the corner of the L-curve, that determines the regularizing iteration number. Numerical results on the collection of test problems [SIAM J. Sci.

A zeroth-order regularization functional is used to incorporate a priori information about the smoothness of the parameters into the problem formulation. We adapt the Butler-Reeds-Dawson (1981) algorithm to solve this optimization problem in three steps. In the first step, the data are compressed using singular value decomposition (SVD) of the kernels. The tensor-product structure of the kernel is exploited so that the compressed data is typically a thousand fold smaller than the original data. This size reduction is crucial for fast optimization. In the second step, the constrained optimization problem is transformed to an unconstrained optimization problem in the compressed data space. In the third step, a suboptimal value of the smoothing parameter is chosen by the BRD method. Steps 2 and 3 are iterated until convergence of the algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on simulated data.},

However, based on the available information, it is not always easy to know how well a particular method will perform in a given situation and how it compares to other methods. This paper reviews most of the existing parameter choice methods, and evaluates and compares them in a large simulation study for spectral cut-off and Tikhonov regularization. The test cases cover a wide range of linear inverse problems with both white and colored stochastic noise. The results show some marked differences between the methods, in particular, in their stability with respect to the noise and its type. We conclude with a table of properties of the methods and a summary of the simulation results, from which we identify the best methods."

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Low-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (LR-NMR) relaxometry is a powerful tool that can be harnessed for characterizing constituents in complex materials. Conversion of the relaxation signal into a continuous distribution of relaxation components is an ill-posed inverse Laplace transform problem. The most common numerical method implemented today for dealing with this kind of problem is based on L2-norm regularization. However, sparse representation methods via L1 regularization and convex optimization are a relatively new approach for effective analysis and processing of digital images and signals. In this article, a numerical optimization method for analyzing LR-NMR data by including non-negativity constraints and L1 regularization and by applying a convex optimization solver PDCO, a primal-dual interior method for convex objectives, that allows general linear constraints to be treated as linear operators is presented. The integrated approach includes validation of analyses by simulations, testing repeatability of experiments, and validation of the model and its statistical assumptions. The proposed method provides better resolved and more accurate solutions when compared with those suggested by existing tools. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
